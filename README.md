## Tech and Approach

This project is a personal portfolio app created using React, Javascript, and CSS. It uses routing to navigate through three main pages -- a homepage, an about page, and a projects page. There is a Chinese character feature on the homepage that routes to a display of data from a Chinese character and premodern text API. 

The design approach I took was clean, minimal, and responsive. Content is a spread out on different pages to minimize scrolling and crowding. For links to displayed API data, a back button seemed an intuitive way to help navigate that feature. CSS was tested across different screen sizes for readability and navigability.   


## Unsolved Problems

As it stands, the API I chose doesn't display very interesting data about the characters displayed on the homepage, such as the meaning and significance of the character. This is partly due the tricky nature of language-related data, which can be quite unruly, but a solution might be to use multiple APIs.

An image should be added for each project displayed to add visual interest and a project preview.
